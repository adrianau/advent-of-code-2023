# advent-of-code-2023
My attempts at solving the puzzles from [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

Puzzle inputs not included as per the [FAQ](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about#faq_copying):
> **Can I copy/redistribute part of Advent of Code?** Please don't. Advent of Code is free to use, not free to copy. If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs. If you're making a website, please don't make it look like Advent of Code or name it something similar.
